            Outfit Parts Overhaul changes how maintenance works, placing greater emphasis on using the right tools and parts to maintain your equipment.\n \n
			%c[pda_green]I. Parts and Maintenance%c[ui_gray_1]\n
            \n• Outfits have a maximum condition. This is determined by the average condition of their parts.
            \n• Outfit repair items work from 0%, however, they can only restore up to the max condition.
            \n• Heavier armors need stronger repair items.
            \n• Technicians will restore all parts to 100%.
            \n• Damage taken by the suit over time degrades max condition. Different parts degrade at different speeds.
            \n \n
			%c[pda_green]II. Repair and workshop changes%c[ui_gray_1]\n
            \n• Certain repair items (sewing kits and repair kits) repair the parts in the suit. This in turn restores max condition.
            \n• Basic sewing kits can fix fabrics. Advanced and heavy sewing kits can fix retardants and fabrics. Repair kits fix everything but helmets.
            \n• Each kit restores a variable amount of condition, prioritizing the parts it can repair first. For example, in a suit with equally damaged ballistic, retardant, and fabric components, the ballistics take priority.
            \n• By themselves, sewing and repair kits restore very little max condition. Outfit parts can be used as support items for repair to greatly enhance max condition restored.
            \n• Use a 100% part that is used in the suit to maximize part condition restored (up to 3x!).
            \n• Workshop replacement of parts does not restore max condition. To compensate, it is free and doesn't consume charges of repair kit.
			\n \n
            %c[pda_green]III. Armor Ripper%c[ui_gray_1]\n
            \n• You can disassemble outfit parts to get base components!
            \n• To disassemble, use an appropriate tool or drag-drop a tool onto a part.
            \n• Condition affects amount of components you get.
            \n• Outfit part components are used to assemble other outfit parts. The recipes are distributed amongst Advanced Kit books.
