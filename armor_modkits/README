Standalone addon that adds armor modification kits. Armor modification kits are consumable items that let you transform one outfit into another outfit in the same family - e.g. Sunrise suits can be repainted, Ecologist SSP suits can be converted between colors. There are also sets that allow you to install exoskeletons on some suits. These can be purchased either at technicians or very rarely looted.

Do note that installing a mod strips out the upgrades - there is a slider that determines how many upgrades are remanded.

Works standalone or with OPO.
